# IIP Capstone Project – Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether a bank customer will leave the bank based on their demographics and financial information.

This project aims to develop your skills in:
- Classification tasks
- Data preprocessing
- Predictive modeling
- Dashboard communication

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed a dataset containing various details about bank customers.
The main tasks completed were:

1. Predict Customer Churn:
   Built a machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.

2. Feature Impact Analysis:
   Identified and analyzed the most important variables influencing customer churn.

3. Recommendations:
   Provided actionable insights to the firm based on data patterns and model interpretation.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- RowNumber: Row index in the dataset.
- CustomerId: Unique customer identifier.
- Surname: Customer's last name.
- CreditScore: Customer’s credit score.
- Geography: Country of residence.
- Age: Customer’s age.
- Tenure: Years the customer has stayed with the bank.
- Balance: Account balance of the customer.
- NumOfProducts: Number of bank products used.
- HasCrCard: Indicates if the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- IsActiveMember: Indicates if the customer is an active member (1 = Active, 0 = Inactive).
- EstimatedSalary: Customer’s estimated yearly salary.
- Exited: Target variable; 1 if the customer left the bank, 0 if retained.
